### The Scoring Equipment

El Plato: Main pot that is being played for at a particular time.
Also acts as the dealer token.

Plato para los pajaritos: Used to store initial stakes. Replenishes the plato when it is empty and there's no debts.

### The Deal

At the start of the game session, each player pays a pajarito ($5) to the to the *plato para los pajaritos*

If the plato is empty, and there are no outstanding debts recorded on the scoresheet, the dealer takes one of the parajitos from the plato para los parajitos and transfers it to the plato.
The dealer then adds $1 from his own bowl to the plato and places it to his right.
It will then contain $6.

If the plato already has money from a previous hand, or there is debt, the dealer just adds $1 to the plato.

Dealer deals out cards in batches of 3 until all players have 9 cards.
The remaining 13 cards are placed face-down as el montÃ³n.

### The Bidding

Player to the dealer's left speaks first.
There are 3 possible contracts:

* Entrada: Declarer chooses trump and exchanges cards
* Vuelta: Top card of the heap is flipped up. The suit of that card is trump. Declarer gets that card and exchanges with the heap.
* Solo: Declarer chooses trump, but does not exchange. Opponents may exchange as normal

The declarer will be the player willing to play the highest contract. The tie-breaker is player order: forehand > middlehand > dealer.
Winner of the bidding can choose a higher contract.

Example:

* FH: "Juego" (Entrada, Vuelta, or Solo)
* MH: "Juego mas" (Vuelta or Solo)
* D: "Paso"
* FH: "Juego tambien" (Vuelta or Solo, has higher priority)
* MH: "Juego mas, solo"
* FH: "Paso"
* MH: "Solo a copas"

If all 3 players pass, the player who has the *espada* must play *entrada*. This is called *espada forzada*. If noone has the *espada* the deal is canceled. The turn passes to the next dealer and they pay $1 to the pot as usual.

If it's a 4-player game, the 4th player players (*penetro*).
They take the heap, discard 1 card. One of the other players drop out.

### The Exchange

* Entrada: Declarer discards any number of cards, then draws from the heap.
* Vuelta: Declarer flips card, discards any number of cards, then draw from the heap with the first card being the first replacement.
* Solo: Declarer does not exchange at all.

The opponents then draw.
They decide amongst themselves who should draw first.
The opponent to the left of the dealer talks first:

* "Vienen"/I'll draw
* "Como quiera"/Maybe
* "Usted"/You

If first opponent says "maybe" or "you". The second opponent may draw or say "you" in return saying that they have a weak hand.

The first opponent to draw will discard first, then draw.
If there are any cards left in the heap, the other opponent may draw.

### The Play

Players must follow suit if able.
If unable, they may play any card, including trump.

The obligation to follow suit does not play to the *estuche*.
When a trump is led, the holder of an *estuche* is not obligated play it unless a higher *estuche* has been LED (If it's the 2nd card in the trick, the 3rd player is not obligated to play a lower *estuche*).
As an example, a player starts the trick with the *espada*.
The other player has no other trump suit cards but has the *mala*.
They have to play it.

Outcomes:
* Sacado: Declarer takes 5 tricks
* Puesta: Tied with one of the defenders.
* Codillo: Declarer takes 4 or less. One of the opponents win.

There are special cases of *puesta* when the declarer loses but the opponents tie: ***puesta sabia*** (3-3-3) and ***puesta real*** (1-4-4).

Winning all 9 tricks is called ***bola***.
If the declarer wins first 5 tricks, they then decide to continue for *bola* or end the hand.
Bola contract is separate from initial contract.

#### Surrender

If the contract is *entrada* or *vuelta*, the declarer may attempt to surrender before playing to the 4th trick.
If the opponents accept, it's *puesta*.
Either opponent may decide to continue the hand, becoming the declarer themselves.
The former declarer becomes a defender.

A *solo* cannot be surrendered.
A *penetro* can only be surrendered at the start of the hand.

### Scoring

#### Puesta

This is the "amount in play" (AIP).
AIP is money in the *plato* + $1 from opponents.

First Puesta: No debts and plato only has *pajarito* and dealer blind.
* Sacado: Win AIP
* Puesta: Pay AIP to plato
* Codillo: Pay AIP to plato and pay AIP to winning opponent

Example: In the first hand, theres $6 in the *plato* ($5 from *pajarito* and $1 from dealer). The AIP is $8.

Puesta in the *plato*: *plato* has amount paid by losing declarer.
* Sacado: Win AIP
* Puesta: AIP is written in debt sheet.
* Codillo: AIP is written in debt sheet and pay AIP to winning opponent.

Example: Declarer lost 1st hand so now the *plato* has $14.
The AIP is $16.

Reserved Puesta: Debts on the sheet and no money in the *plato* other than dealer blinds.
* Sacado: Win *plato* + largest debt.
* Puesta: Same debt is added to declarer's debt.
* Codillo: Same debt is added and pay winning opponent same amount.

The AIP is the largest debt + the dealer blind in the *plato*.

Example: The largest debt is $19 for South and there's $1 in the plato.
North wins $19 from South and the $1 from the plato.
South's debt is crossed out.

There are extra complications if original declarer surrenders, but one of the opponents continues as the new declarer.

* New opponent wins: Original pays new. Plato/debts are unchanged.
* New opponent is puesta: Both generate a puesta
* New opponent is codillo: Old generates puesta and new generates puesta and pays the winner

TODO: Twin Puestas

#### Condiciones

These are payed by the losers to the winner.

* Vuelta: $1
* Solo: $2
* Penetro: $1
* Primeras: $1 (Win first 5 tricks and stop)
* Bola: $8
